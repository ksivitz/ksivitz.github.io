## Black Friday

### Project description:

The purpose of this project is to analyze customer data from Black Friday purchases and attempt to understand purchasing behavior and create a prediction model to capitalize on this behavior through personalized promotions. We will first analyze the given data to see what kind of correlation the different features have with each other and determine what model would best be able to predict these purchasing habits.   

### 1. The Data

The dataset provided by the company contains several useful columns with information about their customers such as: Age, Gender, Marital Status, the type of city they live in, how long they have been there, as well as what products they purchased and their cost. Using this data, we can begin to determine what kind of correlation we have between the various features and their relationship to the customersâ€™ purchases.

The first thing we will look at is our purchases. The following distribution plot shows that purchase amounts range from 0 to $25000, with the average spent skewing towards $5000 - $10000.

As you can see from these first two graphs the majority of our purchases come from customers between the ages of 18-45, with age range 26-35 being our largest customer base.

However, each customer tends to spend roughly the same amount of money, regardless of their age range.

Another factor we can explore is occupation. The data has been split into 20 different job types, and it is clear from the following graph that what type of job a person has greatly affects the purchasing amount spent on Black Friday.

We can also see from the following pie chart that the largest share of purchases come from customers living in city type B, with only a quarter of purchases coming from customers in city type A.

### 2. Model Training and Evaluation 

Now that we have explored our data, it is time to start predicting. Because we have a mix of both numerical and classification features, I have decided that a Random Forest Regression model is the best model to use in predicting customer purchasing habits. Using this model, we can get a prediction score of 68%, with a root mean squared error of $2,828.
